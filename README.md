This analytics dashboard aims to offer a preview of how public libraries are used in California. Consolidated datasets available for all California State public libraries in the United States are used for analysis. In the dashboard, metrics related to usage of library infrastructure with respect to physical versus electronic resources, physical visitors, circulation per capita, visits per capita, collection per capita, expenses per capita. Some of the questions that will be addressed are - What are the metrics for a public library available? How has the public library usage evolved through the pandemic? Will having libraries with a large physical space and higher electronic usage still make sense post the pandemic? Does library usage depend on the median income of a region? Are virtual or in-person library programs well attended?
